once upon a time in a forest, there was a Hare and a Tortoise. One day, the Hare saw the Tortoise walk and started thinking to himslef how slow the Tortoise is. 
The Hare thought about racing the Tortoise and humiliating the Tortoise in front of all the other animals.
The Hare walked up to the Tortoise. "yo," said the Hare. "If you have guts, then accept my challenge to a race."
The Tortoise accepted the challenge and they went home. The Hare layed down in his bed and while he was sleeping, he had a vivid dream.
